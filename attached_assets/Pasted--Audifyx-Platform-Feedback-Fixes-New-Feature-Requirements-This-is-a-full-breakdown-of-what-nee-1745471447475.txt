🛠️ Audifyx Platform Feedback, Fixes & New Feature Requirements
This is a full breakdown of what needs to be fixed, added, and implemented to bring Audifyx up to standard for social interaction, creator tools, and monetization. Please read everything carefully and implement each section.

✅ General Additions
Implement a Points System across the app:

Users earn points through:

Posting content

Gaining likes/comments/reposts

Streaming or going live

Referrals (optional: invite system)

Points should be visible on user profiles.

Add a USD conversion display for points.

Ex: 1000 points = $10

Points can be redeemed through a request form, with payouts via Solana wallet.

🏠 1. Home Dashboard
Make it more social:

Show posts from followed users and trending creators.

Include like, comment, and repost buttons on each post.

Display how many points earned from each post (optional but encouraged).

Trending creators should be sorted based on interactions and points earned.

🔍 2. Discover Tab
Fully redesign to include:

Trending songs/music.

Top creators of the week.

Suggested users to follow (based on activity/interests).

Ensure dynamic filtering, not hardcoded content.

📺 3. Livestream Tab
Remove ALL dummy content from user livestreams.

Only show users who are currently live.

Include viewer count and allow quick follow/join interaction.

Show points earned from live streams (per view, per like).

👤 4. Profiles
Clicking any profile (from post, livestream, etc.) should take the user to their public profile page.

Profile must include:

Display name, bio, followers/following count.

Public posts or songs.

Total points earned.

Add Follow/Unfollow button on every profile.

Include DM and Call from profile screen.

💬 5. Messaging & Calling
Add a scrollable list of all users (or filtered to following/followers).

When inside a message/call view:

Display avatar + name.

Allow quick profile access via tap/click.

👣 6. Bottom Navigation: Profile Tab
This must route to the currently logged-in user's profile.

Ensure persistent routing — doesn't reset after refreshing.

💼 7. Creator & Brand Hubs
Fix the Creator Hub and Brand Hub buttons so they:

Route to the full dashboards: CreatorHub.tsx and BrandHub.tsx

Display stats like:

Total content uploaded

Followers/fans

Points earned

Earnings in USD

💸 8. Request Payout System (Points → USD → Solana)
When users want to redeem points for real currency, they must:

Add a new page: Redeem.tsx or PayoutRequest.tsx
Form Fields Should Include:

Upload profile image (for verification)

Display how many points earned

Input field: "How much are you redeeming?" (must be less than or equal to earned)

Show conversion to USD

Input: Solana Wallet Address

Submit Button: “Request Payout”

When user submits:
Email the request details to: loops4aiden@gmail.com

Email body must include:

Username

How many points redeemed

Wallet address

USD equivalent

(Optional) Store payout requests in Supabase under PayoutRequests table with timestamp/status.
